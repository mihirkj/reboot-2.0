<b>Problem #1 : Block System call : </b>
 <ul>
   <li> block system call for date command </li>
   <li> that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept </li>
   <li> do the same Firefox as well </li>
  </ul>

<b>Problem #2 :  play with directory</b> 

<b>1)</b> create a directory without name from command line

For creating a directory without name I thought of naming it with a blank character which does not takes any space. I used a UTF-8 character named "ZERO WIDTH SPACE" (U+200B), for which no name of the directory is displayed in file explorer applications and also in the terminal by using the 'ls' command.

The commands used:

```bash
mkdir -v â€‹
```

(used "-v" to see the verbose output of the operation)

TO verify this I created a new directory inside the one without name, changed the path into it and showed the present working directory:

(Here the directory without name under the reboot directory can be seen.)

<br/>

<b>2)</b> create a directory with name "-okgoogle"

This task seemed straightforward but the presence of the hyphen before okgoogle caused problems. That hyphen was being regarded as the start of one of the command options for the 'mkdir' command. To tackle this double hyphens (--) can be used which signify the end of the command options and thus the beginning of the arguments. In this case the aurgument is the name of the directory to be created.

```bash
mkdir -v -- -okgoogle
```

<b>Problem #3 :  create a directory structure</b> (You are only allowed to use a single command and only one time)

![alt text](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x6vLWgVIU7Q/XvjlJyKJsnI/AAAAAAAAU0M/lmH8ddGkm90gXPNwUZCUvwCTN6XfJINZgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2B2020-06-29%2Bat%2B12.12.55%2BAM.png)

To create a directory structure like this the mkdir command can be used with curly braces to make muliple directories at the same location. Also, to be able to create it at once the parents tag (-p) is needed to avoid the need to first create directories at one level, and then changing the path to those directories to make directories further down. the final command looks like this:

```
mkdir -p A/{B/{G/K/Reboot.txt,H/J/Reboot.txt},C/{I/J/Reboot.txt,J/L/Reboot.txt},D/{F/L/Reboot.txt,E/M/Reboot.txt}}
```

Further, the tree command can be used to view the directory structure of A in a tree like format for easy visualisation.

```
tree A
```

It shows the following output:

<b>Problem #4 : share files and folders </b>
<ul>
 <li>create two users name jack and Jill  from command line </li>
 <li>create all the data under home directory of each users </li>
 <li>login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack" </li>
 <li>from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 </li>
 <li>now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil" </li>
 <li>from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 </li>
</ul>
