 Problem #2 :  play with directory 

1) create a directory without name from command line

For creating a directory without name I thought of naming it with a blank character which does not takes any space. I used a UTF-8 character named "ZERO WIDTH SPACE" (U+200B),
for which no name of the directory is displayed in file explorer applications and also in the terminal by using the 'ls' command.

> mkdir -v â€‹
